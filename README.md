# Linux Configuration

This contains comprehensive instructions on how to recreate my preferred Linux environment.  
This will always be a work in progress as Linux changes, and as I change.  

## Operating System

Ubuntu 23.04 - Minimal install  

## Applications

### General

- Firefox
- KeePassXC
- [Material-Shell](https://github.com/material-shell/material-shell)
  - A [small bug](https://github.com/material-shell/material-shell/issues/553) exists right now that prevents "Super + D" from functioning. The "Hide All Windows" shortcut uses "`CTRL + Super + D`" AND "`Super + D`" and needs unbound in Settings > Keyboard Shortcuts`.
  - It might be worth moving to [AwesomeWM](https://github.com/awesomeWM/awesome) and this [AwesomeWM theme](https://github.com/HikariKnight/material-awesome) for further customization. - It also gives better mouse control.
- Rustdesk
- VLC
